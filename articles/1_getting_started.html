<p>This first chapter will teach you how to start using eye tracking in a brand new application or in your existing one.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>No development for eye tracking could be successfully done without device itself. If you have a laptop or a monitor with built-in eye tracker you are most probably ready to proceed with development. 
If you have peripheral eye tracker, then follow the instructions included with it to download and install the correct Tobii Engine runtime software. 
Make sure the eye tracker and software is working correctly.</p>
<h3 id="creating-console-application">Creating console application</h3>
<p>If you want to begin from scratch, the easiest way will be to create a new console application using C#. Open your Visual Studio desktop app and make sure you created one. </p>
<h3 id="adding-eye-tracking-to-an-existing-application">Adding eye tracking to an existing application</h3>
<p>You don&#39;t necessarily need to create a new application to start using eye tracking. Maybe you already have your amazing application and only lack some gaze based features to it. Depending on what it is 
you can jump into <strong>Getting started with WPF</strong> or <strong>Getting started with WinForms</strong>. If it is neither of those you are welcome to continue to read this chapter.</p>
<h3 id="installing-unified-foundation">Installing Unified Foundation</h3>
<p>We recommend to reference Unified Foundation from NuGet server. To do so, right click on you project&#39;s reference folder and click <em>Manage NuGet Packages...</em>,
search for <em>Unified Foundation</em> and install it. After doing so you will notice that <em>project.json</em> has been added (or updated) in the project folder, 
and your project is now referencing <em>Tobii.EyeX.Model.dll</em> and <em>Tobii.EyeX.Net.dll</em>. We could also recommend to configure your build to use <em>x86</em> architecture instead of <em>ANY CPU</em> to prevent potential warnings.</p>
<h2 id="lets-code">Let&#39;s code</h2>
<p>Now that you have installed all components we will help you to write your first eye tracking feature. It is often that people who have heard about eye tracking 
want to find out where they looking the first time they are using the feature. So we going to do exactly that - output coordinates of your gaze on screen.</p>
<p>Add this to your <em>Program.cs</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">using Tobii.EyeX;

// ...

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var host = new Host();
    var gazePointDataStream = host.Streams.CreateGazePointDataStream();
    gazePointDataStream.GazePoint((gazePointX, gazePointY, _) =&gt; Console.WriteLine(&quot;X: {0} Y:{1}&quot;, gazePointX, gazePointY));
}

// ..
</code></pre><p>When you run this code, if everything were installed correctly, you will be able to see the stream of coordinates of your gaze. Also because we have assumed that you could add eye tracking to your existing
application make sure that if you do not have <em>Console</em> you output this information in suitable for you way. Let&#39;s see what we actually did just now.</p>
<p>First we have instantiated the <a href="../api/Tobii.EyeX.Host.html"><em>Host</em></a> class which serves as entry point into Unified Foundation. 
It provides you with different kind of features, but also it creates connection between your application and the Interaction Engine. </p>
<p>Next we have used <a href="../api/Tobii.EyeX.Host.html"><em>Host</em></a> to instantiate <a href="../api/Tobii.EyeX.GazePointDataStream.html">stream</a> of <a href="../api/Tobii.EyeX.GazePointData.html">gaze data</a>, which contains coordinates of your gaze location and timestamp. </p>
<p>Finally we have subscribed to the stream with call-back function, which will be invoked when new data will be pushed to the stream.  </p>
